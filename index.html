            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.</p>

              <p class="c2">Japan remains consistently at the top internationally in both science and math and in comparison the United States is not where it needs to be. Japanese education has produced many benefits for not only the individual student but for the nation as well. Their well-educated citizens help to strengthen national democracy in the work force by providing high productivity in a competitive economy worldwide. The Japanese education system can offer useful lessons for enhancing teaching and learning in the United States.</p>

                “Please don’t hesitate to contact me…” is a call-to-action prompt that makes use of politeness strategies. It suggests offering assistance to target readers, which is necessary for most, if not all, business-related contexts.
